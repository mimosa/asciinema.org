    <h1>Contributing to the project</h1>
    <p>
      asciinema is open-source software and the service at asciinema.org is
      made available free of charge to anyone. A lot of effort is put in this
      project and it's developed exclusively in free time. If you find the
      service useful, you think it's a great idea or you believe in giving
      back to the open-source community please consider making a financial
      donation or putting your time to improve the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supporting an open-source project feels great. And you can do it in
      many ways. Here is a list of a few things you can do to show your
      appreciation and help asciinema.
    </p>
    <h2 id="donating">Donating</h2>
    <p>
      While the service is free of charge for anyone it still requires
      servers, domains, SSL certificates, storage for backups and other
      resources to keep it running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a donation to help cover these costs. Be it once, be it
      regularly, be it a small or a big amount. Even if it's just
      enough for "a beer", your support helps running the service and
      motivates future developments.
    </p>
    <p>You can choose from several options below to support asciinema financially.</p>
    <h3>Bitcoin</h3>

    <p>
      Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic crypto-currency.

      donate some bitcoins to the project use the following address (you can
      just click it if you use desktop bitcoin wallet).
