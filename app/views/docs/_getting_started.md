## 2. Record

Go to your terminal and run the following command:

    asciinema rec

New shell will be spawned and everything you do in it will get recorded.
When you're ready to finish simply exit the shell either by typing `exit` or
hitting <kbd>Ctrl-D</kdb>.

See [usage instructions](<%= docs_path('usage') %>) to learn about all commands and options.

## 3. Create your profile (optional)

If you want your recordings to be assigned to your asciinema profile run the
following command:

    asciinema auth

If you skip this step now, you can run the above command later and all
previously recorded asciicasts will automatically get assigned to your
profile.

NOTE: To be able to edit/delete your recordings you have to assign them to
your profile.
